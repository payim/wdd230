            <h2>Something About Ghana</h2>
            <p>
                
                Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African country to gain 
                independence from colonial rule: Ghana was colonised by the
                British until it gained its independence on March 6, 1957, 
                led by Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah. Ghana’s
                independence was a major milestone in the history of Africa, 
                inspiring other African countries to fight for their
                independence from colonial powers. This event marked the 
                birth of a new era in Africa, characterised by a spirit of
                freedom, hope, and dignity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name “Ghana” means “warrior king” in the Soninke language: 
                The name “Ghana” was adopted when the country gained
                independence in 1957, inspired by the ancient Ghana Empire
                 that existed in West Africa from the 6th to the 13th century.
                The Ghana Empire was known for its strong military and trade 
                relations with North Africa and the Mediterranean world.
                The name “Ghana” reflects the country’s rich history and 
                cultural heritage, reminding its people of their past glories
                and achievements.
