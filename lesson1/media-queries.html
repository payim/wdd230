            <h2>Matt 5:19,22</h2>
            <p>Whosoever therefore shall bbreak one of these least commandments, and shall cteach men so, he shall be called the least
            in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and dteach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
            heaven. <br>
            <p> I say unto you, That whosoever is aangry with his brother bwithout a cause shall be cin danger of the judgment: and
            whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be ein danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall
            be in danger of hell fire.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 7:44,45</h2>
            <p>If so, his afaith and hope is vain, for none is bacceptable before God, save the cmeek and lowly in heart; and if a man
            be meek and lowly in heart, and dconfesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have
            charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.<br>
            <p>And acharity suffereth long, and is bkind, and cenvieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily
            dprovoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all
            things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
